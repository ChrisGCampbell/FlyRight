## API

Currently we do not have a postman workspace because we are cheap. We do have a readme with endpoint details [here](https://github.com/samcrane8/FlyRight/tree/master/docs). We generate the documents with a project called [Postdown](https://github.com/TitorX/Postdown). The only issue is that Postdown does not currently handle Folders nor empty description/queries properly, so I had to fork the repo. I have a pull request waiting but in the meantime, you can use my fork [here](https://github.com/samcrane8/Postdown).

## Partners

[Georgia Tech Police Department](http://www.police.gatech.edu/) was critical in the development of this system. The original IcarusMap project was with head of Physical Security, Jeffrey Hunnicutt, who met with our team weekly to hone this product to best help the campus.

## Contributors

### Initial Team

This codebase started as a junior design project at Georgia Tech. The original version was called IcarusMap.

The team involved was the following:

Kaan GÃ¶ksal - https://github.com/kaangoksal

Antonia Deliyianni - https://github.com/adeliyianni3

Raymond Zhang - https://github.com/rzhang339

Timothy Lee O'Connor - https://github.com/tjlo3

Ladd Jones - https://github.com/laddjones

Though this project has jumped different repositories and it does not show in the git history, these people were involved at the beginning and deserve credit.

### Pelori

Sam Crane subsequently founded [Pelori](https://www.pelori.io) as a robotic solutions provider. Pelori provides deployment and server maintenance solutions, and is a major contributor to the FlyRight source code.
